Abstractâ€” The TurtleBot 3 Burger robot, a popular platform for robotics research and education, presents a practical solution for simulating and experimenting with autonomous navigation using ROS 1 Noetic. The system leverages ROS for its robust framework in perception, planning, and control, and the simulation environment provides a comprehensive platform for testing various navigation algorithms. Utilizing a combination of LiDAR technology and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), the TurtleBot 3 Burger can create detailed maps of its surroundings, detect obstacles, and navigate efficiently in dynamic indoor environments. The integration of Gazebo for simulation offers a realistic setting to validate the robot's behavior under different conditions. This simulation platform supports diverse applications, from educational purposes to research in service robotics, allowing for the development and testing of advanced autonomous navigation systems within a controlled and reproducible environment.
