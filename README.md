# Autonomous-Mobile-Robot

In the realm of indoor robotics, navigation poses a critical challenge across service robots, humanoids, and warehouse automation.Existing techniques like line following,RFID tracking, and Aruco marker-based systems exhibit limitations in autonomy and adaptability. This has created a need for the development of an advanced and sophisticated autonomous navigation system that encompasses self-reliant perception, planning, and control capabilities. The proposed system makes use of LiDAR technology for mapping and Robot operating system for planning and control which takes place on Jetson Nano GPU platform, providing real-time processing power for environmental data. LiDAR sensors offer accurate environmental perception, obstacle detection, and adaptability to dynamic indoor settings. The system employs BLDC wheels and an aluminium base for versatility, supporting loads up to 120 kg. Additionally, it incorporates an IMU sensor with EKF sensor fusion for accurately estimating the robot's position. This flexible design has applications in various indoor robotics scenarios, ranging from complex service tasks to efficient warehouse operations. This versatile design finds applications in various indoor robotics scenarios, from complex service tasks to efficient warehouse operations.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

üìåGlobal costmap: This costmap is used to generate long term plans over the entire environment‚Ä¶.for example, to calculate the shortest path from point A to point B               
on  a map.
üìåLocal costmap: This costmap is used to generate short term plans over the environment‚Ä¶.for example, to avoid obstacles.

üìåmap frame has its origin at some arbitrarily chosen point in the world. This coordinate frame is fixed in the world
üìåodom frame has its origin at the point where the robot is initialized. This coordinate frame is fixed in the world.
üìåbase_footprint has its origin directly under the center of the robot. It is the 2D pose of the robot. This coordinate frame moves    as the robot moves.
üìåbase_link has its origin directly at the pivot point or center of the robot. This coordinate frame moves as the robot moves.
 üìålaser_link has its origin at the center of the laser sensor (i.e. LIDAR). This coordinate frame remains fixed (i.e. ‚Äústatic‚Äù) relative to the base_link. 

üìå problem:To convert a detected object‚Äôs coordinates in the LIDAR coordinate frame to equivalent coordinates in the robot base‚Äôs frame. 
solution:ROS has a package called tf to handle all these coordinate transforms for us.

üìå/right_ticks : Tick counts from the right motor encoder (std_msgs/Int16)
üìå/left_ticks : Tick counts from the left motor encoder (std_msgs/Int16)
üìå/initial_2d : The initial position and orientation of the robot.(geometry_msgs/PoseStamped)

The publisher will publish odometry data to the following topics:

üìå/odom_data_quat : Position and velocity estimate. The orientation is in quaternion format. (nav_msgs/Odometry)

üìå2D Pose Estimate button:

Published Topic: initialpose
Type: geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped
Description: Allows the user to initialize the localization system used by the navigation stack by setting the pose of the robot in the world.

üìå2D Nav Goal button:

Published Topic: move_base_simple/goal
Type: geometry_msgs/PoseStamped
Description: Allows the user to send a goal to the navigation by setting a desired pose for the robot to achieve.

üìå/initial_2d topic (which the odometry publisher subscribes to) (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped)
üìå/goal_2d topic (which our path planner node, which I‚Äôll create in a later tutorial, will subscribe to). (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped)

üìå/scan :  Laser scan messages from the LIDAR (sensor_msgs/LaserScan).
üìå/tf : Coordinate frame transformations (tf/tfMessage).
üìå/initialpose : The initial position and orientation of the robot using quaternions. (geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped) ‚Äî RViz initial pose button publishes to this topic.
üìå/map : The occupancy grid map created using gmapping, Hector SLAM, or manually using an image (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid).

The amcl node will publish to the following topics:

üìå/amcl_pose : Robot‚Äôs estimated pose in the map (geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped).
üìå/particlecloud: The set of pose estimates being maintained by the filter (geometry_msgs/PoseArray).
üìå/tf (tf/tfMessage): Publishes the transform from odom (which can be remapped via the ~odom_frame_id parameter) to map.
