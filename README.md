In the realm of indoor robotics, navigation poses a critical challenge across service robots, humanoids, and warehouse automation.Existing techniques like line following,RFID tracking, and Aruco marker-based systems exhibit limitations in autonomy and adaptability. This has created a need for the development of an advanced and sophisticated autonomous navigation system that encompasses self-reliant perception, planning, and control capabilities. The proposed system makes use of LiDAR technology for mapping and Robot operating system for planning and control which takes place on Jetson Nano GPU platform, providing real-time processing power for environmental data. LiDAR sensors offer accurate environmental perception, obstacle detection, and adaptability to dynamic indoor settings. The system employs BLDC wheels and an aluminium base for versatility, supporting loads up to 120 kg. Additionally, it incorporates an IMU sensor with EKF sensor fusion for accurately estimating the robot's position. This flexible design has applications in various indoor robotics scenarios, ranging from complex service tasks to efficient warehouse operations.
